## Introduction

In the domain of natural gas network systems, precise state estimation amid measurement noise is critical for maintaining both operational efficacy and safety. This project introduces an approach that enhances the robustness of state estimation processes under noisy conditions by integrating sophisticated noise filtering techniques within a data-driven framework. Unlike conventional methods that often accept noisy measurements without modification, our method appliestargeted filtering strategies to refine the measurements before processing. This proactive filtration is carefully balanced with a weightedlow-rank approximation technique, designed to retain essential data and improve estimation accuracy by exploring potential enhancements with advanced models.
